# OmniLaunchMC

Current status:
* Vanilla Minecraft works
* Everything the Minecraft Launcher supports works and is supported to import from the old one

Life saving npm packages (massive credit to them):
* [request](https://www.npmjs.com/package/request) for making downloading files much easier
* [ncp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ncp) for importing packs from other launchers
* [async](https://www.npmjs.com/package/async) for massive performance boosts
* [mkdirp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mkdirp) for creating many subfolders to save the dependencies
